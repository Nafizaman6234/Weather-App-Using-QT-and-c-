# Weather-App-Using-QT-and-c++
Using Qt Framework and C++ programing language, made a app to fetch weather details from openweathermap.org.

To Run this application and fetch weather application you have to:
1. Create an account on openweathermap.org
2. After creating your account you can find your api key on your account page. If you can't find the key, just google it.
3. after getting your api key you have to open the project on Qt Creator, then come to Sources Directory And select secondwindow.cpp and open it.
4. on line 26 of secondwindow.cpp you will find the place to paste your own api key. just remove the text and paste your api key inside the double quotation and you r done.
5. now run the program in Qt creator and you will see the welcome page first.
6. Press the start button and then the main page will appear where you have to put the name of the place and press Search button and the app will give you the weather application of the place you Searched for.
